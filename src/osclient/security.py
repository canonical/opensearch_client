"""Manage Security plugin accounts: roles, internal users and role mappings.

SKELETON: some functions below are declarations with no behaviour yet.

This module calls the Security REST API through
:meth:`~osclient.client.OpensearchClient.request`; the client has no methods of its
own for it, and the API paths live here. Two parts:

- The classes model the request bodies this module sends, and only the fields a
  service account needs; the API accepts more. Their field names are the JSON
  keys. ``to_dict`` builds a request body. Responses are not parsed into these
  classes: the ``get_*`` and ``list_*`` functions return the response JSON.
- The functions work with those classes and return
  :class:`~osclient.result.OpensearchResult`; an expected failure is a value, not
  an exception.

Documentation of the API, which these docstrings were checked against:

- Roles: https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/security/api/roles/create-role/
- Internal users: https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/security/api/users/create-user/
- Role mappings:
  https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/security/api/role-mappings/create-role-mapping/
- Action groups such as ``index`` and ``read``:
  https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/security/access-control/default-action-groups/
- Permission names such as ``indices:data/write/bulk``:
  https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/security/access-control/permissions/

Rules that apply throughout:

- A class refuses invalid values when it is created: its ``__post_init__`` raises
  ``ValueError``, so an invalid object never exists. A function that takes a bare
  name instead returns a failure.
- Creation is create-only. A role, user or mapping that already exists is never
  overwritten: ``create_*`` returns a failure instead. Replacing means deleting
  and creating again. (The API itself creates or replaces.)
- A password is write-only. It is accepted when a user is created, is never
  returned by the API, and is kept out of ``repr``. Nothing here generates a
  password. Only a plain-text ``password`` is supported, not a ``hash``.
- Secrets are never printed or logged. Output built from a raw API response goes
  through :func:`redact_secrets` first, and a request body is never logged: logs
  may be shipped to the cluster, and a logged password would then be stored in an
  index.

The Security API is served by the cluster's REST port (9200 by default), so
OPENSEARCH_URL should point there. Whether it can also be reached through a
Dashboards console proxy (the OPENSEARCH_DASHBOARD_URL route) has not been
verified.

    A role has cluster permissions and, optionally, one set of index permissions: a

    several such sets, document- and field-level security, and tenant permissions;
    none is needed for the service accounts this module manages.

    API: https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/security/api/roles/create-role/

    Example:
        The request body ``to_dict`` builds. In the API, only the entries of
        ``index_permissions`` have required fields (``index_patterns`` and
        ``allowed_actions``)::

    Attributes:
        name: the role name. In the API it is part of the URL, not a body field.
        cluster_permissions: cluster-level actions or action groups.
        index_patterns: the indexes the index permissions apply to; wildcards
            allowed. Empty for a role with no index permissions.
        index_actions: individual actions or action groups allowed on
            ``index_patterns``, e.g. ``read``. Required when there are patterns.

    Raises:

            patterns are given without actions or the reverse; or if any entry of
