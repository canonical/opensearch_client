"""A logging handler that ships log records to OpenSearch.

The handler is a standard :class:`logging.Handler`: attach it to a logger, and
every record that reaches it is indexed into OpenSearch through an
:class:`~opensearch_client.client.OpensearchClient`. Batching, retries and transport
selection are delegated to :meth:`OpensearchClient.bulk`; this module only adds
what a log handler needs on top of it:

- a bounded in-memory buffer, so logging never blocks on the network;
- a background thread that flushes the buffer by size or by interval;
- a final flush on shutdown, so the last records are not lost;
- an ``ECSLogFormatter`` that converts a ``LogRecord`` into an ECS-style document;
- a guarantee that a shipping failure never raises into the application and
  never feeds back into the handler itself.
